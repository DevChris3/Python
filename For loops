# we can use For loops to execute a block of code for every iteration
# such as every element in a list or every char in a string, etc.,

# syntax of a For loop:

# this is an Assignment
 names = ['chris', 'george', 'jay']

for item_name in names:
    print(item_name)
    
# RESULT
 chris
 george
 jay
 
 # for every item in the LIST called names, the For loop allows you to return each char
 
 # in this example Below...we iterate over a sequence of numbers:
 
 for num in range(1,10):
    print(num)
    
# RESULT

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
NOT INCLUDING THE LAST NUMBER *by default
