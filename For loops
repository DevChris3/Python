# we can use For loops to execute a block of code for every iteration
# such as every element in a list or every char in a string, etc.,

# syntax of a For loop:

# this is an Assignment
 names = ['chris', 'george', 'jay']

for item_name in names:
    print(item_name)
    
# RESULT
 chris
 george
 jay
 
 # for every item in the LIST called names, the For loop allows you to return each char
 
 # in this example Below...we iterate over a sequence of numbers:
 
 for num in range(1,10):
    print(num)
    
# RESULT

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
NOT INCLUDING THE LAST NUMBER *by default


# Example

# create a list of int and iterate through that list using the FOR loop

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for number in my_list:
   print(number)
   
# RESULT

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
# difference between iterating through a list and using the range function:
      - the range function has a {start:stop:step}
      - but HERE i actually created my own list 
            - so python goes through the entire list and returns every char in the list
            
# Example 2:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# this time we will iterate through the list and print out a string instead of the numbers

for num in my_list:
   print("Hello")

# RESULT

Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

# python goes through the LIST and returns the string "Hello" 5 times....
