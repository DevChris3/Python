# LIST are muttable
# in this section i am creating LIST and showing how LIST are muttable = making changes

# store a list of numbers in a variable called {my_list}
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(my_list)

# RESULT
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# using index and slicing
# print my_list from index[1] to [4] not including index[4]

my_list[2]
my_list[1:4]

# RESULT
3
[2,3,4]

# SLICING means to take elements from one given index to another given index
# slicing has a {START:STOP:STEP}
# by default python starts at 0 incrementing by 1
# in this example python starts at 0, stops at 4 and increment by 1 
# in the other example python starts at 0, stops at 4 and increment by 2

my_list[:4:]
my_list[:4:2]

# RESULT
[1,2,3,4]
[1,3]
